# 📚 Documentation Review: Getting Started Guide

## 🎯 Overall Assessment
The documentation provides a solid foundation for developers looking to integrate with the Endaoment platform. Here's my detailed review:

## ✅ Strengths
- **Local Setup Clarity** 🛠️
  - Clear, step-by-step instructions for local environment setup
  - Well-structured and easy to follow

- **Practical Examples** 💡
  - Excellent use of real-world scenarios
  - End-to-end examples for common features like:
    - Organization search
    - DAF creation
  - These examples serve as great starting points for developers

## 🔍 Areas for Improvement
- **Context Gap** 🤔
  - Assumes prior knowledge of Endaoment ecosystem
  - Missing foundational concepts like:
    - What is a DAF? (Donor Advised Fund)
    - Why would someone create a DAF?
    - What value does the SDK provide?

## 💭 Recommendation
Adding a brief "Why Endaoment?" section at the beginning could help developers:
1. Understand the platform's purpose
2. Build a mental model of the system
3. Better appreciate the value proposition

## ⭐ Final Thoughts
While the technical implementation details are well covered, adding more context about the "why" would make this documentation even more valuable for newcomers to the platform.
