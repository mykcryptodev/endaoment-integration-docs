# DAFs as a Service Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for using Endaoment's Donor Advised Fund (DAF) as a Service API.
This API allows you to create and manage Donor Advised Funds as a third-party service, while leveraging Endaoment's expertise in charitable giving.

## Overview

This documentation is broken down into a quickstart example and flow guides.
The quickstart example is a copy-able working implementation of the DAF as a Service API, while the flow guides provide a more in-depth look at the API, its features, and how to use them.
